## General
Most of the time, start each statement with a **verb**. Avoid "you can..." and "there are..." etc.

## Headings
Keep headings short.
Headings must be specific. The lower is the heading level, the more specific it must be. For example, a second-level heading should be more specific than a first-level heading and so on.

The heading should concentrate on what users can achieve or what they need to know.
Avoid mentioning products/features/functions/commands and so on in headings.

Use parallel sentence structure for all headings at the same level. For example, use noun phrases for first-level headings, verb phrases for second-level headings, and infinitive phrases for headings in instructions.

Consider infinitive phrases, such as "To create a heading", for headings and titles related to tasks. For headings that aren't related to tasks, use a noun phrase such as "Headings", if possible.

## Paragraphs
Keep paragraphs short. Three to seven lines is about the right length for a paragraph.

Paragraphs should have extra space between them. For example, 50% of the line spacing, or half the font size.

## Lists
Introduce the list with a heading, a complete sentence, or a fragment that ends with a colon.

A list should have at least two items but no more than seven items.

Keep list items short.

Keep list items consistent. For example, each item should be a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.

Don’t use a period at the end of list items unless they’re complete sentences, even if the complete sentence is very short. Don’t use semicolons, commas, or conjunctions (like and or or) at the end of list items.
Don’t use periods if all items have three or fewer words or if the items are UI labels, headings, subheadings, strings, or similar types of text.
