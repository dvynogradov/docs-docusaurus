# Database dictionary
This article describes how to create a database dictionary for a relational database.

## What's a database dictionary?
Relational databases store data in tables, which can be grouped into schemas. The goal of the database dictionary is to describe the purpose, structure and attributes of each table in the database. The attributes are table columns (also called fields), column descriptions, data types, constraints and so on.
