# How to install PgSQL

## Prerequisites
This article uses a [PosgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database as an example.  to test this step on your local machine, you will need the following:
1. Install PostgreSQL -- visit [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org) for installation instructions.
2. Install a SQL client. For example, [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org), which is free just like PostgreSQL itself. Another option is [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io), which has a free Community version.
