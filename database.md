# How to document a relational database

## Overview
This artile provides basic guidelines for documenting relational databases using a PostgreSQL database as an example.

## Prerequisites
If you want to follow along with the examples in this article, you'll need to install the following:
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) or any other database administration tool that supports PostgreSQL.
- [Sample DVD rental database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/).

Also, if you have no experience with relational databases, you might want to learn some basics for better understanding of this article. For example:
- [What is a relational database?](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-relational-database) by Google.
- [Relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) on Wikipedia.  

## What is a database documentation?
Database documentation usually consists of:
- A database dictionary, which describes all tables that exist in a database (each table's columns, data types, keys, nullability). It can also describe views, stored procedures etc.
- An entity relationship diagram (which provides a high-level view of all tables and the relationships between them).
